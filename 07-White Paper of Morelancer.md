# White Paper of Morelancer

## Preface
It is good to build a virtual ideal state, 
but what is more urgent than that is to guarantee the lives of the people.

The most important thing Mortopia has to do is secure people's jobs and help them make their own lives.

Lately I've been doing a lot of research on freelance sites.

The most active sites include toptal, upwork, and freelancers.

However, these sites have limitations.

- Site administration is very dictatorial.

- For the benefit of operating the site, the user's convenience is greatly limited.

- There are many fraudulent and irresponsible customers and freelancers.

- People who do not have a PayPal account are excluded.

- Anonymity is not guaranteed.

## Efforts to improve the freelance market
There are attempts to improve freelance sites using cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Cryptocurrency allows us to serve people who don't have a bank account or PayPal and keep fees low.

Smart contracts eliminate administrator discretion in site operation 
and enable fairness and transparency to be ensured.

Examples include ethlancer.com and blocklancer.net.

In particular, in the blocklancer.net white paper, 
the court's operating rules are very reasonable, 
and the method of overcoming revenge in the review is relatively good.

However, in reality, blocklancer.net are not active compared to upwork or freelancers.

I thought about the cause.

First of all, it is an important reason that
people do not have enough understanding of cryptocurrencies.

Also, the high fee of Ethereum transactions is another reason.

However, I believe that the essential cause is
that the site operation wasn't improved more actively according to the actual situation.

Thus, I had the intention to open a new freelance site-morelancer,
which more fully completes the idea of the blocklancer.net site.

morelancer site will belong to Moretopia in the future.

Since morelancer has the same philosophy as blocklancer.net,
it is desirable to establish a mutual cooperative relationship.

## Some rules of the new freelacing site, morelancer
Contents different from previous sites were described.

### Post Fee
The client must pay a fee to post the project.

The purpose of this fee is to prevent overuse of Project Post rather than to increase the site's income.

The post fee is a fixed amount regardless of the amount of the project.

### Payment Deposit
The client must make a payment deposit when posting the project.

The payment deposit is not the site's income and, in principle, is fully refunded to the client.

The payment deposit is established to eliminate fraudulent behavior of clients and to guarantee safe payment to freelancers.

In case of an hourly project, the amount of the payment depositis one week's payment,
and in case of a budget type project, it is set to be the same as the proposed amount.

If the client disappears after the start of the project
or if the client refuses to pay even though the project was performed as requested,
the problem is resolved with the payment deposit.

### Project withdrawal
The client can withdraw the project he has posted.

In this case, the payment deposit is returned to the client.

If the project has not yet been bid by a freelancer, the deposit will be returned in full.

If there are some bids for the project, the amount of the bid is deducted 
from the deposit to the freelancer and the rest is returned to the client.

In order to withdraw a project that has already started, 
the client must agree on a compensation amount with the hired freelancer.

In the case of hourly payment, the standard of compensation is an additional payment for one week.

In the case of a budget-type project, the amount of compensation 
is determined by comprehensively calculating the schedule, elapsed time, and the amount already paid.

If a freelancer makes an unreasonable claim for compensation,
the client may request that it be resolved by trial.

### Forcible disposition of payment deposit
If the client disappears after the project starts, 
the deposit will be frozen for a certain period of time.

After the freeze period, the freelancer is compensated and the rest is site acquisition.

If a dispute arises after project implementation, 
the deposit will be disposed of according to the judgment of the court.

### Work Deposit
Freelancers with insufficient skills sometimes take on tasks that exceed their abilities irresponsibly.

In addition, there are cases in which freelancers fail to perform tasks within the due date or disappear irresponsibly during the execution.

In this case, the client loses time.

To prevent this, freelancers must pay a work deposit when they are hired for a project.

This deposit is not the site's income and is only a means to prevent cheating.

When the project is over, the work deposit is returned to the freelancer in full,
regardless of performance.

The amount of the work deposit is determined by mutual agreement between the freelancer and the client.

Therefore, if the freelancer does not have sufficient funds,
the deposit may not be paid if the client agrees.

In this case, the client is responsible for it.

### Forcible Disposition of Work Deposit
If a freelancer disappears during project execution, 
the work deposit is frozen and the client obtains it after the freeze period.

### Bid Fee
Some freelancers bid on projects they don't understand, 
creating chaos on the site, stealing clients' time, and indirectly harming other freelancers.

In order to prevent this, Blocklancer.net limits the number of bids per week.

However, this rule is unreasonable when several people use one account jointly.

Therefore, it is more reasonable to set the bead rate.

The bid fee is the site's income.

For the convenience of freelancers, a certain amount of free bids is set.

If the client hires the freelancer, the bid fee is returned to the freelancer.

This is a rule to further encourage suitable bids.

In addition, if the client recognizes that the bid is beneficial, 
the bid fee is returned to the freelancer.

This rule was also established to further encourage appropriate bids.

If the client withdraws from the project bid by the freelancer, 
the freelancer not only receives a refund of the fee, but rather gets a profit equal to the bid fee.

### Bead Withdrawal
Freelancers can withdraw bids that have not been interviewed.

Part of the bid fee will be returned when the bid is withdrawn.

However, bids that have already been interviewed cannot be withdrawn.

### Broadcast Message
Broadcast messages sent to all freelancers or all clients can provide convenience to users.

The broadcast message fee is the site's income.

### Withdrawal of work
Freelancers can withdraw from projects they have already started.

To do this, the freelancer must agree with the client.

In case of withdrawal without agreement with the client, the work deposit is obtained to the client.

### Dispute Resolution
Dispute resolution is basically done as pointed out in the blocklancer white paper.

### Review Rules
Since the current review is an evaluation of the other party after project implementation,
in principle, it is difficult to eliminate revenge.

The review in the new site is not a review of the other party, but a review of the project implementation.

The review score is based on the score given by both parties.

For example, if a client gives a review score of 1 and a freelancer gives 5 points,
the review score of the two people is the same (5+1)/2=3.

Even from a logical point of view, it is not well understood that 
either party can receive high reviews if the project execution is not successful.

If the freelancer is directly responsible for not performing well on the project, 
the client is responsible for not choosing the freelancer well.

Under the new review rules, both sides will refrain from revenge in order 
to get a good review score and will try to choose the other side more carefully.

Under the new review rules, even if the project was not carried out properly, 
if both sides exercise self-control, they can give each other 5 points.

If you want to take revenge, you should write your review like that.

With the new review rules, there is no need for arbitration for reviews.

Even if the review content is unsatisfactory, 
it is part of the historical record and should not be modified.

### Currency Exchange Service
In a situation where many people are not yet familiar with cryptocurrencies,
morelancer site need to provide currency exchange services between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.

In addition, on condition that people from various countries use the site, 
it is necessary to provide currency exchange services in various national currencies.

### Client Support Service
In general, it can be assumed that freelancers are experts, but clients are not.

When a client who lacks professional knowledge posts a project,
he or she raises technically unreasonable demands or fails to accurately describe the project.

In many cases, this is the cause of the discrepancy of understanding between each other in the future.

In order to solve this problem, professional assistance must be provided 
so that the client can write the post content accurately.

Alternatively, professional assistance may be required in hiring freelancers.

In addition to the above rules, the rules are continuously revised and supplemented 
in consideration of the opinions of users.

### Adoption of better blockchain
Ethereum is a widely generalized blockchain, but the transaction price is high.

Therefore, the price issue can be seriously considered and other blockchains can be adopted.

As an alternative, attention is paid to the high-speed and low-priced Solana.

However, if Ethereum is developed to 2.0 and the speed and price problems are resolved,
Ethereum can continue to be used.

### The sources of income for the new site are as follows.
- project completion fee
- post fee
- bid fee
- tribunal income
- income from currency exchange services
- Broadcast Message Fee
- Client Support Service Fee
