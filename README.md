# Moretopia
Moretopia is a virtual country on the Internet that implements its laws as smart contracts.

It is easy for some serious people to view the virtual country as a useless prank or even a scam.

Perhaps do you think so too?

But then you need to think seriously again.

## First, Let's talk about scams.

If you are not familiar with smart contracts, you can think of them as open contracts whose reliability is absolutely guaranteed by technology.

Smart contracts are open to all, and their execution is absolutely correct, so there can be no fraud.

Even if you don't believe in the honesty of God, you can't help but believe in the honesty of smart contracts.

## Second, Let's talk about unnecessary pranks.

Pranks aren't always superfluous.

For instance, the pranks that a person plays in childhood may seem useless at first glance, but from a scientific point of view it is not only beneficial but also absolutly necessary.

Pranks are a type of activity to gain experience and skill.

Those who did not play a lot of pranks when they were young will inevitably pay the price when they become adults and encounter real situations.

Now, people are discussing important social issues and policies only with words, but compared to that, how practical and intuitive is this social experiment called moretopia.

Even if Moretopia does not succeed, it will record an important experimental data for the construction of an ideal society, and mankind will learn a very useful lesson.

## Third, You can also think of Moretopia as the world's largest masquerade ball.

This masquerade ball helps to color people's lives.

In fact, the content of many movies is far from reality, but movies have become a part of people's lives.

Moreover, this masquerade ball can really help people's lives through borderless payments and freelance marketing.

## Fourth, Anyone has certain curiosity.

Science has already proven that curiosity is one of the most essential components of human intelligence.

Still, if you criticize Moretopia, I would like to ask you.

"Aren't you even curious about that?"

## Last, My Expectation

If you understood what I was saying, I think you would support Moretopia or at least wouldn't criticize it.

I expect that the Moretopia concept will evolve from the germination stage to the growth stage with the support of many people including you.

I hope that you will introduce Moretopia to your family and friends and have many useful discussions with them.

In particular, if you are a leader in blockchain technology, I hope for your active interest for Moretopia.

I am waiting for your support or your criticize at sun901073@gmail.com.

Thank you.
