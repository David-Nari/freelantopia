Moretopia is a virtual country on the Internet that implements its laws as smart contracts.

If you are not familiar with smart contracts, you can think of them as open contracts whose reliability is absolutely guaranteed by technology.

It is easy for some serious people to view the virtual nation as a useless prank or even a scam.

Perhaps do you not think so too?
But then you need to think seriously again.

> First, let's talk about scams.

Even if you don't believe in honesty of me David , you cannot help yourself but believe in
the smart contract's honesty.

Smart contracts are open to all, and their execution is absolutely correct, so there can be no fraud.

> Second, let's talk about unnecessary pranks.

Pranks aren't always superfluous.

For instance, the pranks that a person plays in childhood may seem useless at first glance, 
but from a scientific point of view it is not only beneficial but also absolutly necessary.

Pranks are a type of activity to gain experience and skill.

Those who did not play a lot of  pranks when they were young will inevitably pay the price 
when they become adults and encounter real situations.

Now, people are discussing important social issues and policies only with words, 
but compared to that, how practical and intuitive is this social experiment called moretopia.

Even if Moretopia does not succeed, it will record an important experimental data
for the construction of an ideal society, and mankind will learn a very useful lesson.

> Third, you can also think of Moretopia as the world's largest masquerade.

This masquerade can bring people a happy life.

Numerous movies have become a part of people's lives, but in fact, the contents of the movies are far from reality.

This masquerade can really help people's lives through borderless payments and freelance marketing.

> Fourth, anyone has certain curiosity.

Science has already proven that curiosity is one of the most essential components of human intelligence.

Still, if you criticize Moretopia, I would like to ask you.

"Aren't you even curious about that?"

If you understood what I was saying, I think you would support Moretopia or at least wouldn't criticize it.
I expect that the Moretopia concept will evolve from the germination stage to the growth stage with the support of many people including you.
I hope that you will introduce Moretopia to your family and friends and have many useful discussions with them.
In particular, if you are a leader in blockchain technology, I hope for your active interest for Moretopia.

I am waiting for your support or your criticize at sun901073@gmail.com.

Thank you.

David Nari.
