##Preface
2021 = 1516 + 505
  
505 years have passed since Sir Thomas More wrote the book "Utopia" in 1516.

The word "Moretopia" means Thomas More's Utopia or  more than Utopia.

The word "Utopia" was already being used too much, so it was not easy to create a new word with "Utopia".

##Purpose of Moretopia
Living in an ideal society, an ideal country, is the historical longing of all mankind.

Although great social progress has been made throughout history, this dream still remains unresolved.

In today's information age, humanity has gained the technological potential to make this dream a reality.

Today, mankind is facing numerous difficult problems, such as environmental change, epidemics, poverty, 
refugees, sustainable development, terrorism threats, wear and tear of moral values, abuse of power and disorder,
corruption and false propaganda, and hypocritical election promises.

In order to solve those problems, all mankind and all nations must work together.

However, this problem has not been well resolved due to many causes such as conflict of interests and differences in ideology.

This reality shows that a practical model of human unity and cooperation is required.

- The purpose of Moretopia is to prove experimentally that the ideal of mankind 
is never a vain dream, and that we can make it a reality if we work hard.

In other words, it can be said that it is an experiment of ideal country construction.

If this experiment is successful, we will be able to create an example of the first successful 
ideal country in history and show it to mankind around the world.

- The purpose of Moretopia is to provide people with more employment and development opportunities.

- The purpose of Moretopia is to provide all people with a borderless payment and financial tool.

- The purpose of Moretopia is to revitalize cultural and technological exchanges around the world.

- The purpose of Moretopia is to encourage the cultural development of mankind and to realize their full potential.

- The purpose of Moretopia is to create a model of human unity and cooperation to cope with global challenges 
including environmental problems, infectious diseases, and sustainable development.

- The purpose of Moretopia is to deepen understanding and friendship among people around the world,
and to eliminate all kinds of terrorism, human hatred, exclusivity, prejudice and hatred.

- The purpose of Moretopia is to encourage the expression of humanity's noblest emotions and
ideas, including compassion, love, cooperation, and humanitarianism.

##Moretopia's Ideology
Moretopia's ideology is justice and respect for human rights, freedom and democracy,
humanitarianism and protection of property rights, progress and development, peace and friendship, unity and cooperation.

##Moretopia's Political method
Voting is the basic political method of Moretopia, and all important policies of Moretopia are decided by voting.

Moretopia guarantees transparency in policy formulation and implementation.

##Moretopia's Law
The law has served in the past and present as one of the basic means of ruling all countrys.

The law is essential to the operation of the state, but historically,
the law has always served the interests of those in power first, and it has been hypocritical compared to the wording of the law.

Smart contracts can put an end to this unbeautiful history.

The reliability and value of smart contracts as a product of modern information technology have been sufficiently proven through practice.

- Moretopia's law is a smart contract written in accordance with this white paper.

- Once the law is written as a smart contract, it is in principle impossible to use the law unfairly according to the purpose of a specific authority or group, and all hypocrisy is eliminated.

This will make people have a firm trust in the rightness of the virtual country, and this trust will be the spiritual foundations for the successful formation of the virtual country.
